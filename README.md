## Installation

### From PyPI (Coming Soon)

Once published, you can install bellhop with pre-compiled binaries:

```bash
pip install bellhop
```

This includes pre-built Fortran executables for Linux, macOS, and Windows, so you don't need to compile anything yourself.

### From Source

See the [compilation and installation guide](https://avc-adelaide.github.io/bellhoppe/page/installation.html) for building from source.


## Background

* Bellhop is an underwater acoustics simulator, part of the [Acoustics Toolbox](http://oalib.hlsresearch.com/AcousticsToolbox/) by Michael B. Porter and colleagues.

* The Bellhop component of the Acoustics Toolbox has been extracted UCal San Diego to support the [multithreaded C++/CUDA version: `bellhopcuda`](https://github.com/A-New-BellHope/bellhopcuda). The UCal team also [maintain a fork of the Fortran sources](https://github.com/A-New-BellHope/bellhop) with numerical properties and robustness improved and bugs fixed; some of these changes have been back-ported into the Acoustics Toolbox directly but the codebases are no longer identical

* A Python wrapper for Bellhop was previously provided within the [`arlpy` package](https://github.com/org-arl/arlpy) by Mandar Chitre at the Acoustic Research Laboratory, National University of Singapore. arlpy has been superceded by a Julia wrapper by the same author within [UnderwaterAcoustics.jl](https://github.com/org-arl/UnderwaterAcoustics.jl).

* An alternative Python interface is provided in [PYAT](https://github.com/BochicTrdar/PYAT) by Orlando Camargo Rodríguez.

* This repository, from Adelaide University, Australia, is a subsequent consolidation of several components of these works, with the intention of providing a clean and well-documented repository to provide easier access to the Bellhop code. The main features of the AU work are:
    * Consolidation of code files and build processes with a single set of clean sources
    * Adaptation and extension of the `arlpy`-based Python wrapper for Bellhop
    * Updated Fortran source code with automated documentation using FORD and lint checking using `fortitude`
    * Addition of explicit regression and unit test files using `pytest`
    * Continuous integration through Github for all documentation, linting, test suite, and code coverage
    * PyPI packaging with pre-compiled binaries for easy installation across Linux, macOS, and Windows
