The Python Bellhop wrapper supports multiple models, which can be automatically detected depending on the environment parameters and task being computed.
The main feature this enables is to provide seamless access to Bellhop3D.

## Bellhop3D environment definition

Bellhop3D differs from Bellhop (2D) in roughly four ways:
* Sources and receivers are now defined in 3D:
    * The source location can be shifted to any $(x,y,z)$ coordinate
    * The receiver locations can vary in their bearing angle $\theta$, with positions defined in cylindical coordinates $(r,\theta,z)$
* Altimetry, bathymetry, speed of sound profiles, etc., are defined in 3D.
* The beam fan is defined in both spherical directions (elevation, bearing).
* The simulation can be set to either 2.5D or full 3D:
    * 3D allows refraction horizontally due to lateral changes in sound speed;
    * 2.5D traces beams along 3D directions but every beam is restricted to travel along a vertically-oriented plane (i.e., a straight line when viewed from above).

## Bellhop3D rays

Load Bellhop and check the standard models available out of the box:
```{python}
import bellhop as bh
print(bh.models())

env = bh.Environment(name="Example Bellhop3D",dimension="3D").check()
assert env.dimension == "3D"
assert env._dimension == 3

results = bh.compute_rays(env)
print(results)
```
